The thing about projects is always stumbling on familiar hurdles that you seem to fail to tackle on your own because you are not familiar with the learning process.

It can also be because you are not able to visualize a system on the get go. it can be quite frustrating even if now, the age of information where resources are abundant and rich.

Im not here to teach you how to code or how to create a beautiful UI, But guide you on what you might need on your road to create the next big thing.

## Everything is a System

Whether you are designing a database, an interface or writing an algorithm. It is always good to have a system, this helps to make the work look standardized and improves consistency.

Having a system prevents the hassle of working out little details in the process but anticipate them.

This can be a naming system, A color system  or even any convection that will connect all the pieces of your project.

You can clearly see the importance of creating a system from this book written by the team behind Tailwind css [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) which further exaplains how establishing a spacing and sizing system promotes consistency and does not slow you during the design process.

## Get Inspired

There is always something better. People are naturally innovative and different people have different ways of bringing their ideas to life.

Not everyone is plato but it is possible to think like him and become a student of his craft.

Do not be a closed box, besides following latest trends and new tech, it is better to look for people that think outside the box, People who look at coding with a different perspective and have their own paradigm shifting tactics that they use.

The fact that someone is doing the same thing as you but he is doing it differently should not only amaze but also make you curious enough to think why that person chose that way.

I never knew I would be more productive with neovim until I tried it. Goals should not be the only thing that drives your inspiration but also curiosity and experimentation.

This will help you to look at projects from different angles thereby moving you away from the generic steps that you may have been taking.

Recently i have been greatly inspired by the works of [Writer of Strange Software](https://twitter.com/DrMiaow)

## Final Words

Programming is not esoteric.
