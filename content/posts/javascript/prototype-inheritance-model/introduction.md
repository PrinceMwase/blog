when i started to learn javascript in 2014, one thing that usually came up is the fact that javascript is not an object oriented language.

That was okay with me since using classes and objects was not something i was intending to use. as i grew with the language and learnt other programming paradigms i got confident with the concept of classes.

Fast forward to 2017 after a rather disturbing hiatus to programming, now javascript has classes. so i decided to ride the wave of the fancy new EcmaScript Standard. learning this was a breeze and by then i knew js was not really an oop language but uses what is called *prototype inheritance model*...

Thats something i have not learned in any of the programming courses from school, my idea of it was still lacking, its now that i got confident to do deeper to the underlying technology that drives javascript.

The past weeks has been me researching the topic and im excited to write about what i have learned so far.
