That was okay with me since using classes and objects was not something i was intending to use. as i grew with the language and learnt other programming paradigms i got confident with the concept of classes.
Fast forward to 2017 after a rather disturbing hiatus to programming, now javascript has classes.</description></item></channel></rss>
