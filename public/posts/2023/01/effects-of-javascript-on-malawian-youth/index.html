In recent years, there has been a growing interest in teaching JavaScript to young developers in countries like Malawi, as a way to provide them with the skills they need to succeed in the global technology industry.</p><p>There are several reasons why learning JavaScript can be beneficial for young developers in Malawi. For one, JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple websites to complex web-based software. This means that young developers who learn JavaScript will have a wide range of career opportunities available to them.</p><p>Another benefit of learning JavaScript is that it can help to bridge the digital divide between Malawi and more developed countries. As more and more businesses and organizations around the world rely on the internet and web-based technologies, the ability to create and maintain web-based applications has become increasingly important. By learning JavaScript, young developers in Malawi can gain the skills they need to participate in this global industry.</p><p>Despite the many benefits of learning JavaScript, there are also several challenges that young developers in Malawi may face. One major challenge is access to resources and training. In many rural areas of Malawi, there are few computer labs or internet-equipped classrooms, which can make it difficult for students to learn to code. Additionally, many young developers in Malawi may not have access to the same resources and support that their peers in more developed countries do.</p><p>Another challenge that young developers in Malawi may face is a lack of role models and mentors. In a field that is dominated by men and people from developed countries, it can be difficult for young developers in Malawi to see themselves as successful software developers.</p><p>There are also several challenges that must be overcome. With the right resources and support, however, it is possible for young developers in Malawi to gain the skills they need to succeed in the global technology industry. As more and more businesses and organizations around the world rely on the internet and web-based technologies, it is essential to ensure that young people in Malawi have the opportunity to learn these in-demand skills.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://goonie.netlify.app/tags/untagged/>untagged</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>386 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2023-01-11 14:28</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://goonie.netlify.app/posts/2023/01/understanding-variable-scope-in-javascript/><span class=button__icon>‚Üê</span>
